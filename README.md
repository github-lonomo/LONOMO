# LONOMO
Life collaboration platform. A place to find solutions to problems do scientific research and in general find the best way to solve and do something. Likeminded people who want to see a world of peace progress scientific discoveries and understanding of us and the world around us. 
I need a purpose something to work on that I believen so I can dedicate my life to. This is a platform where we are looking to collect information and define pathways so we can try a couple of different options in order to increase our chances to find a purpose which has the most utility. A purpose which is naturally aligned with your personal life phylosophy is very much needed and serves a good cause (makes a positive difference in the life of others without being damaging to the environment and other social groups and entities)

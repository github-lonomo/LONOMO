# LONOMO
Life collaboration platform. A place to find solutions to problems do scientific research and in general find the best way to solve and do something. It is aimed at grouping Likeminded people who want to see a world of peace progress scientific discoveries and understanding of us and the world around us. 
I need a purpose! Something to work on that I believe in so I can dedicate my life to. This is a platform where we are looking to collect information and define pathways so we can try a couple of different options in order to increase our chances to find a purpose which has the most utility for you personally as an unique individual. A purpose which is naturally aligned with your personal life phylosophy is very much needed and serves a good cause (makes a positive difference in the life of others without being damaging to the environment and other social groups and entities) and is something that you naturally understand. 

We aim to acieve that by gethering and systematising knowledge in a way which leads to understanding. We aim to cross the boundaries of categorical thinking and expand our understanding of the world around us, humanity and its social structures. We aim to bring in understanding of the whole complexity of the world the way it is and not in an oversimplified and categirised for simplicity and ease of understanding form. The above task is not easy I know but that is not a reason to give up and not attept to   Science sais that the human brain is one of the most complex structures in the known universe.
